new content from original piece
- user can input name (!!!!)
- the pop ups are *actually* pop ups (from https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_popup.aspâ€”which I CAN copy legally+it actually makes sense to me lol)
- more files to click through on the homescreen :)

i am really happy with this version

it may be too similar to the original, but honestly, i think it's better, and it's simpler, and more fun for me :) plus i can add more interaction, since it's less javascript and more html/css, which i am 10,000x more comfortable with
