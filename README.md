new content from original piece
- user can input name (!!!!)
- the pop ups are *actually* pop ups (from https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_popup.aspâ€”which I CAN copy legally+it actually makes sense to me lol)
- files to click through on the homescreen :)
- javaSCRIPT not p5.js because honestly having to go through a sketch for all the <script> stuff would be a nightmare + javascript is the same + easier to use once you understand the stuff from w3 schools lol (i know it's an art class but like i don't really enjoy p5.js and it was a genuine nightmare to use for the final so if that makes me fail, then I actually don't know what to do lol)

i am really happy with this version

it may be too similar to the original, but honestly, i think it's better, and it's simpler, and more fun for me :) plus i can add more interaction, since it's less javascript and more html/css, which i am 10,000x more comfortable with
