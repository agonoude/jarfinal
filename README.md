NOTE: the audio files are from youtube; i listen to all of those songs too much they will not miss the miniscule amount featured on my page lol


new content from original piece
- user can input name (!!!!)
- the pop ups are *actually* pop ups (from https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_popup.aspâ€”which I CAN copy legally+it actually makes sense to me lol)
- files to click through on the homescreen :)
- more animations
- javaSCRIPT not p5.js because honestly having to go through a sketch for all the <script> stuff would be a nightmare + javascript is the same + easier to use once you understand the stuff from w3 schools lol (i know it's an art class but like i don't really enjoy p5.js and it was a genuine nightmare to use for the final so if that makes me fail, then i actually don't know what to do or tell you lol)

i am really happy with this version

it may be too similar to the original, but honestly, i think it's better, and it's simpler, and more fun for me :) plus i can add more interaction, since it's less javascript and more html/css, which i am 10,000x more comfortable with

things i want to do in the future (probably once i get back from driving to almost iowa, by saturday at noon):
- more tom pop ups lol
- more files to search through
- my own interactive file layouts + stuff (probably using screenshots from my half broken windows laptop lol)

but that's a lot of work that takes a lot of time
